# Project: CoderCo Assignment 1 - Open Source App Hosted on Azure with Terraform üöÄ

## Overview

This project mirrors the AWS ECS-based setup, but we will now deploy the open-source app on Azure using Azure Container Apps. 

The goal is to package, build, and deploy an application using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring best practices in infrastructure as code, security, and scalability.

Key Components:
- Azure Container Registry (ACR) for container images.
- Azure Container Apps (or AKS) to run containers.
- Azure Application Gateway or Front Door for HTTPS routing.
- GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps for CI/CD (your choice).

## Task/Assignment üìù

- Create a repository for your work.
- Containerize the app and push it to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
- Use a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or another) to build, test, and push the container image.
- Deploy the app on Azure using Terraform:
  - Azure Container Apps
- Expose the application via HTTPS using Azure Application Gateway or Azure Front Door.
- Ensure the app is available at:
  - https://tm.<your-domain>.co.uk or
  - https://tm.labs.<your-domain>.co.uk
- Add screenshots of the live app to the README.md.
- Include an architecture diagram of your infrastructure (Lucidchart, draw.io, or Mermaid).

## Guidance & Hints üìö

### Directory Structure

- `terraform/` - Terraform configuration for Azure resources. Use modules for reusable components.
- `app/` -  App code and Dockerfile.
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions). Or any other CI/CD tool you want to use.
- `docs/` - Documentation for the project. Diagrams/Architectures.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

### Local app üíª

```bash
cd app

### create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
### run the app
python3 app.py ## python3 app.py
```

### API

```bash
# Create task
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"New Task"}' http://localhost:3000/tasks

# List tasks
curl http://localhost:3000/tasks

# Update task
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"completed":true}' http://localhost:3000/tasks/1

# Delete task
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/tasks/1
```
